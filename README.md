### Project 20: Exploring Explainability for Time Series Representations Learned through Self-Supervised Learning.

In this project we explore the use of the RELAX method to provide explainability for representations of spectograms learned through both self-supervised and supervised learning.

Furthermore, we explore the use of segmentation based methods such as SINEX and a SINEXC inspired algorithm. 

We test the methods using two different pre-trained models, therefore the repository is split into a folder for each model each containing an `explainer-notebook` that reproduces the results from the report.
